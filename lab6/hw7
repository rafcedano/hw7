Thanks to my lab partener Donovan, I was able to catch up with this lab. 
An interaction we focused on was how "General Health" and "Life Satification" interacts with the other three varibales, (Race, Hispanic, and Education) for Marijuana use. 
For General Health it seemed that the more people use Marijuana the worst their health is and the better they rate their health the less Marijuana they will be using. This isn't a direct correlation
however it is good to know for example, if your a substance abuse counselor, that for your clients who use Marijuana they will be more likely to have health issues which can effect how you engage them in counseling.
For Life satifaction there were a statitcally signifant amount of responses for satified and also a statitically signifant amount of responses for i dont know and refused responses. Before running the code I assumed that 
more satified people will be using marijuana more than the not satified people due to the euphoric effects of the drug. However the data shows that the responeses for Marijuana users and their life satification most users
did not answer or did not know which shows that there are most likelty other things interacting with satification beside Marijuana use that have an effect on people's answers.


I want to focus on the way technologyâ€™s impact on our everyday lives has become greater and greater through the years, especially after covid. Our economy keeps changing and im curious how peoples salaries have changed, how remote jobs became more common or popular. and how social interaction decreased. How the effects of the pandemic are still relevant, but now that its post 4 years, its relevance has taken a back seat. Im having trouble finding a paper because I need to figure out exactly what data from the brfss i want to use.
